this project was a 3d printed chef holding a an oven (screen) with recipe instructions with a led matrix face and was battery powered. It was operated with a motion sensor, button and potentiometer. It had a menu that would allow you find an (easy, medium, or hard) recipe and what type (breakfast, lunch or dinner) of meal was needed to be made, and then it would go trhough the ingredients using the motion sensor as to not get hardware dirty and then displays the instructions from the data .json file.
